## 🔐 **What I Need Access For**

### **I Cannot Do Automatically (Requires Your Approval/Access):**

#### **1. Push to GitHub**
- **What I need:** Your GitHub credentials OR permission to push
- **Why:** To deploy to Streamlit Cloud, code must be on GitHub
- **Alternative:** You can push manually (I'll tell you exactly what to do)

#### **2. Deploy to Streamlit Cloud**
- **What I need:** Your Streamlit Cloud account access OR you sign in
- **Why:** Streamlit Cloud requires GitHub OAuth authentication
- **Alternative:** I can provide exact steps, you click the buttons

#### **3. Edit SharePoint Page**
- **What I need:** SharePoint edit permissions OR you paste the embed code
- **Why:** SharePoint requires your login to edit pages
- **Alternative:** I'll give you the exact code to paste
